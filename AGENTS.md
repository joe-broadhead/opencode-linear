# Repository rules

This repository builds `@joe-broadhead/opencode-linear`, an OpenCode plugin that registers Linear's official MCP
server and adds default permission rules, a status command, a status dialog, two skills and a tools RPC for scripts.
Read [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) before you change code, and [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for
the checks and the release steps.

## Rules

- **Public API only.** Use only the public `@opencode/plugin` 2.2.3 API. `opencode.host` in `package.json` and
  `SUPPORTED_HOST` in `src/constants.ts` both say exactly `>=2.2.3 <2.3.0`, never `^2.2.3`.
- **Greenfield.** No legacy, migration code, compatibility shim, dual path or deprecated alias, and nothing dead.
  Delete rather than deprecate.
- **No peers, no runtime dependencies, no lifecycle scripts.** `@opencode/plugin` and `@opencode/sdk` are
  devDependencies pinned to exactly `2.2.3`. Do not add another host version to the lockfile.
- **Ship prebuilt, one file per entry.** `scripts/build.mjs` bundles `src/index.ts` and `src/tui.ts` with esbuild into
  the self-contained `dist/index.js` and `dist/tui.js`: no chunks, no relative imports, and only host-provided modules
  external. `tsc` only typechecks. No declaration files, `.tsx` or JSX.
- **Default rules, not hooks.** Permissions come from rules inserted through `ctx.agent.transform` directly after each
  agent's base allow. A stricter agent is never weakened. Agents that miss the rules are named in status with the
  per-agent fix, never patched, and the fix never goes in the top-level `permissions`.
- **Transforms are cheap, synchronous and never throw.** Record failures for status instead.
- **Errors** read `CODE: What happened. Next step: What to do.`, built by `linearError` or `errorText`. Codes have no
  service prefix; shared failures use the shared names (`HOST_UNTESTED`, `OPTIONS_INVALID`, `STATUS_UNAVAILABLE`,
  `SKILLS_INVALID`).
- **`src/linear-tools.ts` has no runtime imports.** The drift script loads it with Node's type stripping.
- **TypeScript.** No enums, namespaces or parameter properties. `import type` for types, `.js` in relative imports.
- **The tools RPC.** `src/host/tools-rpc.ts` is a copy of a module shared by several plugins. Change only its block
  between the `PLUGIN-SPECIFIC` markers here; change the rest in the shared copy first. Its methods are `READ_TOOLS`
  and nothing else: never a write or an unknown tool. Keep the RPC id `linear.workspace.tools` and its method names
  stable: scripts call them by name.
- **Tests.** Unit tests use narrow `Pick<Plugin.Context, ...>` fakes. Host tests use the public `@opencode/sdk` with
  `OpenCode.create({ app: { version } })`, a loopback fake server and the temp root from `test/host/isolate.ts`.
  Never sign in to Linear or call its API from a check.
- **Text.** Model-facing text and docs use plain language and describe what the code does now: no process
  narrative, test counts, machine-local paths, secrets or personal data.
- **Releases** come from a `v<version>` tag on `master`. The release workflow refuses a private package or a tag that
  differs from the version; no test or script checks `private`.
- **One check command.** `npm run check` passes before every commit. Never skip, weaken or delete a test to get
  green.

## Forbidden in this repository

`scripts/check-forbidden.mjs` enforces this list in `src/`, `test/`, `scripts/` and `dist/`:

- dispatch-lease, catalog-ownership and text-only markers, and tool `options.mcp` delegation;
- `Plugin.image` and profile images;
- imported OAuth grants;
- the V1 plugin API: `@opencode-ai/*` packages and hooks such as `tool.execute.before`, `chat.message` or
  `permission.ask`;
- the deprecated `ctx.generate.text` and `experimental.policies`;
- importing `@opencode/ai`;
- a permission hook, except the one `permission.hook("evaluate")` in `src/host/tools-rpc.ts` (and the bundle that
  inlines it), exactly once each: it turns an `ask` on one of the tools RPC's own script calls in flight into a deny,
  because no one can answer it, and touches nothing else;
- references to private host source or host checkouts;
- machine-local home and temp paths;
- `.tsx` or `.jsx` files in `dist/`.

The pack test also rejects anything in `dist/` other than the two bundles, any relative, dynamic or `require` import in
them, and any import of a module OpenCode does not provide.
